# Calculator

# Objective
A calculator's primary function is to produce a computed result in response to a set of input parameters. In a 'session' mode, these systems are utilized. A calculation/evaluation is conducted when the user submits values for a number of parameters. After that, the user can change the variable input parameters and request that the computation be repeated. This might happen several times until the user has gotten all of the information they need and decides to end the session. Assembly language was used to create this calculator.

# Theory
A calculator is a device that uses numbers to execute arithmetic operations. Only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are possible with the most basic calculators. Exponential operations, roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions are all handled by more advanced calculators. Internally, some calculators accomplish all of these tasks through repeating addition processes.
